# UnitfulConventionalMoles

This module defines molecular mass units with conventional molecular weights,
using Unitful.jl and UnitfulMoles.jl.

Atomic weights taken from:

*Atomic weights of the elements 2013 (IUPAC Technical  Report)*

http://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2015-0305

Weights in g are provided with 5 digit precision, using "Conventional" weights
where a range is provided.
